#> The project reflection is complete and describes development and learning well, shows careful thought, highlights insights made during code development.


## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
#It took me about four days.
#Note: You may like to use the WakaTime plugin, which tracks exactly how long you spend in code. See http://wakatime.com (but note that the free version only has a 7-day history)

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
#What I am most satisfied with is that I have completed this assignment with no bug

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
#Some code looks weird and not all code is useful

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
#At the beginning, I was very confused about assignment2 and didn't know how to start. I watched the recording repeatedly to understand what I should do. Recording is really useful

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
#To be honest I don't know how to improve my code, probably just do a lot of practice

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
#I checked a lot of materials and websites, especially CSDN, there are detailed explanations and tutorials on this website, and netizens will also teach you enthusiastically.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
#The main challenge was that I didn't know anything about kivy at first, and I found the process from researching materials to completing assignments to be very challenging and painful.

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
#Using classes makes my code look more concise and the logic is smoother. Although I don't know its usage very well now, it does benefit me a lot.
