Reading Tracker 1.0.

Date: 2022 - 04 - 13.

Author:Li Junlu

Description: This program works as a reading tracker that helps the user
to know which book is required to read and they haven't done it yet.

Basic logic explanation: My program is highly rely on methods. As you can see 
methods almost took all the places here while the main program body only took 
a little..

Precondition: Each line of the csv file where the book information is stored
has to follow the following format -->  TITLE, AUTHOR, PAGES, IF IT'S REQUIRED 
For the last one, in this program, we use 'c' to indicate that a book
is completed and 'r' to indicate that a book is required.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Violating the precondition will result in this program being crashed.
